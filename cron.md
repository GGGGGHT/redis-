# cron 


## server cron
redis server定时任务的主要包括： 
 * 更新服务器的各类统计信息，比如时间 内存占用，数据库占用
 * 清理数据识图中过期键值对
 * 触发BGSAVE或AOF重写
 * 不同类型的客户端超时
 * 如果处于集群模式，对集群进行定期同步和连接测试

```c
/* This is our timer interrupt, called server.hz times per second.
 * Here is where we do a number of things that need to be done asynchronously.
 * For instance:
 *
 * - Active expired keys collection (it is also performed in a lazy way on
 *   lookup).
 * - Software watchdog.
 * - Update some statistic.
 * - Incremental rehashing of the DBs hash tables.
 * - Triggering BGSAVE / AOF rewrite, and handling of terminated children.
 * - Clients timeout of different kinds.
 * - Replication reconnection.
 * - Many more...
 *
 * Everything directly called here will be called server.hz times per second,
 * so in order to throttle execution of things we want to do less frequently
 * a macro is used: run_with_period(milliseconds) { .... }
